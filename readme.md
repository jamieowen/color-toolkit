###Â palettes

Imported json prepared sets of colours - with names if possible.
These are larger collections of colours/shades/tints/etc to map other palettes to.

The other type of palette would be known sets of colours that work ( i.e. like those on colour lovers )
Question is how to we want to

e.g.
pantone list of colours
material ui list of colours - https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-material-color-palette-json
color wheel colours ( so 12 colours or whatever )
color lovers - https://github.com/Jam3/nice-color-palettes

## Other deps.
Color Scheme js
https://github.com/c0bra/color-scheme-js

Seems good for generating palettes from the colour wheel using various colour theory methods ( i.e. analous, split complementary, etc )
Like : http://paletton.com/

Color Difference and Mapping using correct lab space conversion.
https://github.com/markusn/color-diff/

Could use this but probably the above.

# Usage ideas

1. Mapping a set of colours ( with names ) to a larger range in another palette.
i.e : get me all reds of the pantone library.
or: generate a colour palette from an image - then get me all purples.
So - we could take the colour wheel palette then using the color-diff

2. Specular colours / emissive colour permutations.
Look into this more so :

maybe work on a ui to explore these ideas :
